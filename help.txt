Advance Features
1. For language translation:
Enter the keyword 'tl' or 'Tl' or 'tL' or 'TL' and then after type your text. And if you want to get the result in a specific language then you have to specify the language after the keyword.
Example: Tl korean how are you?
If you are not specifying the language then by default it will translate the text from direct language to hindi.
2. For the image operations:
Just send the image and specify what to do with the image in the captions.
Example:
i). extract the text
ii). Edit the image
(P.S. This function is little bit slow but works absolutely fine, I'm working on it)
3. AI Chatting:\nYou can simply chat with the bot.
